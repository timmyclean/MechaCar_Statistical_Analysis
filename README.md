# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

We have been tasked with the following as per AutoRUs';
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a         summary interpretation of the findings.

# Results

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
 * As we see from the summary of the linear regression the variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount if variance to the mpg values in the dataset are vehicle length and ground clearance.

* This also helps us determine that slope of the linear model would not be considered to zero. This is due to the results showing significant linear relationship and each variable is not determined by chance or error.
* This linear model effectively predicts MPG of MechaCar prototypes because of the p-Value.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
* It is our interpretation that MechaCar meets the design specifications in each lot except Lot 3 which has a few cars that don't meet specs. This is due to the findings in the following charts.
